Goal is to code algorithms, puzzles, interview questions in JS/TS every day for the next 100 days

Day 01: ğŸ’¡ fizzbuzz problem

Day 02: ğŸ’¡ Sorting using inbuilt Sort method
            ğŸ”¥ inbuilt sort method mutates original array
        ğŸ’¡ Check if two strings are anagrams
            ğŸ”¥ introduction and usage maps
            ğŸ”¥ usage of for-of statement
            ğŸ”¥ usage of Object.has methods
            ğŸ”¥ usage of Array.from and Array.every methods

Day 03: ğŸ’¡ Palindrome with inbuild methods
        ğŸ’¡ Check permutation of a string is a Palindrome
            ğŸ”¥ usage set
            ğŸ”¥ usage of Set.has, add, delete methods

Day 04: ğŸ’¡ fibonacci series with recursion
            ğŸ”¥ time complexity - O(2 POW N)
            ğŸ”¥ space complexity - O(N)
        ğŸ’¡ fibonacci series with recursion - optimized
            ğŸ”¥ memoization
            ğŸ”¥ time complexity - O(N)
            ğŸ”¥ space complexity - O(N)

Day 05: ğŸ’¡ Leet code : puzzle: First non-repeating character in a string
            ğŸ”¥ use of maps
            ğŸ”¥ time and space complexity O(N) instead of O(N SQR) by avoiding multiple loops

Day 06: ğŸ’¡ Leet code : puzzle: Product of array elements except self
            ğŸ”¥ time and space complexity O(3N): can be improved to O(2N) and eventually O(N) 

Day 07: ğŸ’¡ Leet code : puzzle: Squared array
            ğŸ”¥ Math.abs usage
            ğŸ”¥ time and space complexity O(N)

Day 08: ğŸ’¡ Learnt: bubble sort algorithm - egghead.io
            ğŸ”¥ Good for small size array. bigger element is bubbled to the end 
            ğŸ”¥ time complexity: O(N^2)
            ğŸ”¥ space complexity: O(N)

Day 08: ğŸ’¡ Leet code: determine if sum exists
            ğŸ”¥ time complexity: O(N) and space complexity: O(N) instead of O(N ^ 2)

Day 09: ğŸ’¡ Egghead.io: implementation of breadth first search
            ğŸ”¥ usage of graph in JS

Day 10: ğŸ’¡ Egghead.io: Divide and conquer algorithm
            ğŸ”¥ basic recursion: different way of thinking about a problem
