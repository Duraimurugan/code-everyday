Goal is to code algorithms, puzzles, interview questions in JS/TS every day for the next 100 days

Day 01: 💡 fizzbuzz problem

Day 02: 💡 Sorting using inbuilt Sort method
            🔥 inbuilt sort method mutates original array
        💡 Check if two strings are anagrams
            🔥 introduction and usage maps
            🔥 usage of for-of statement
            🔥 usage of Object.has methods
            🔥 usage of Array.from and Array.every methods

Day 03: 💡 Palindrome with inbuild methods
        💡 Check permutation of a string is a Palindrome
            🔥 usage set
            🔥 usage of Set.has, add, delete methods

Day 04: 💡 fibonacci series with recursion
            🔥 time complexity - O(2 POW N)
            🔥 space complexity - O(N)
        💡 fibonacci series with recursion - optimized
            🔥 memoization
            🔥 time complexity - O(N)
            🔥 space complexity - O(N)
